## Peer Dependencies

The package has **optional** peer dependencies. Install only what you need:

```json
{
  "react": "^18.0.0 || ^19.0.0",
  "@playwright/test": "^1.40.0",
  "lighthouse": ">=11.0.0"
}
```

| Dependency | When to Install |
|------------|-----------------|
| `react` | Using the React provider/hooks in your app |
| `@playwright/test` | Using the Playwright test integration |
| `lighthouse` | Using Lighthouse audits (`npm install -D lighthouse`) |

:::info
All peer dependencies are optional. Install only what you use. Lighthouse is only needed if you configure `lighthouse` thresholds.

## Package Exports

The library provides three import paths:

```ts
// Main entry - re-exports both layers
import { ... } from 'react-performance-tracking';

// React only - provider and hooks
import { ... } from 'react-performance-tracking/react';

// Playwright only - test utilities
import { ... } from 'react-performance-tracking/playwright';
```

Using specific subpaths helps with tree-shaking and keeps your bundles smaller.

## TypeScript Support

The package is written in TypeScript and includes full type definitions. No additional `@types/*` packages needed.

```ts
import type {
  TestConfig,
  PerformanceInstance,
  PerformanceSample,
} from 'react-performance-tracking/playwright';
```
